# Enterprise AI Platform for Real-Time Fraud Detection & Investigation Automation

## Project Overview

This project builds a cloud-native AI platform designed for BFSI institutions to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, automate fraud case summarization using GenAI, and provide dashboards for compliance and risk teams. The platform leverages streaming ingestion, scalable ML models, MLOps pipelines, and governance frameworks to deliver a high-impact, enterprise-grade solution.

## Key Features

- **Real-time transaction ingestion** using Apache Kafka or GCP Pub/Sub  
- **Streaming ETL & feature extraction** with Apache Beam & Dataflow  
- **Fraud detection models** (XGBoost, Deep Neural Networks) deployed on Vertex AI & Kubernetes  
- **GenAI assistant** for fraud case narrative summaries (powered by PaLM 2 / LangChain)  
- **Dashboards** for compliance and risk teams via Looker Studio & Streamlit  
- **Automated CI/CD pipelines** for model & infra deployment using GitHub Actions and Cloud Build  
- **Monitoring & governance** with Prometheus, Grafana, audit logging, and explainability
